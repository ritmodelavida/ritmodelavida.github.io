I am honored as a Playero, Ponceño and Puertorriqueño to share my perspective as an artist who make reference to the arteology. In this installation titled <i>Memory of nature: the rhythm of life</i> I have focused on three aspects of my work as an arteologist. First, I will briefly describe my philosophy as an arteologist and my artistic conception related to this installation. Secondly, i will indicated the mystical aspect of this installation with the mystical vision of the Museo de Arte de Ponce. And, thirdly, to conclude, I want to present my position about the new era as part of this installation.
</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

<p class="p8">
As I stated in my manifesto the arteologist is like the new-born phoenix bird that saved the remains of the ancestors in a sacred place before beginning the journey into a new era. The arteologist meditates on reality by watching and listening to truth rooted in the past, present and future. Like an egregor or a griot, helping to ferment and mature the connections which in contemporary art are linked to cultural identity, historical meaning and spiritual transformation.
</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

<p class="p8">
As the arteologist delves into those holes where it has buried the truth to meet the fertile ground, root and essence derived from the pursuit of truth and transformation, like this has been exploring the aesthetic process for development of this installation for the last six years.
</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

<p class="p8">
<i>Memory of nature: the rhythm of life</i> is precisely the search for the connection that exist with the balance of life which comes from the primordial energies of nature such as the ether, the air, the fire, the earth and the Water. It also comes from ancient cultures such as the Taino, African or Vedic who have greatly influenced our civilization showing us the way towards harmony with nature expressed through symbols or codes that mark the rhythm of life. In addition to establish a language coming from they profound feeling as human beings.
</p>

In this installation I respond to the Caribbean sunlight entering the Museo de Arte de Ponce for the sixth skylight designed by architect Edward Dorell Stone. The influence of vibrational energy sunlight affects us every 24 minutes. This is the same energy vibration in every part of the world. Besides this energy can not be created or destroyed. This is the energy of sunlight projected onto the multimedia assemblage at the center of the installation. The book in this assembage shows two iPads connected to the internet and the website
<a href="http://ritmodelavida.github.io">http://ritmodelavida.github.io</a>
designed exclusively for this installation. The same is supported by a metal frame anchored to a circular base on the floor painting. This website allows us to interact with the symbols of the <i>Tattwas</i> which are represented by the frequency clocks programmed from sunrise in Ponce, Puerto Rico.
</p>

<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8">
This energetic projection is directed from the center of the installation to the four directions where are my interpretation of the <i>Tattwas</i> depicted on the encaustic paintings on each of the walls. Also right on these paintings and bellow the book are displayed a small painting depicting the geometric symbols of the <i>Tattwas</i> to facilitate the interaction between the frequency clocks on the iPads and the paintings.
</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

<p class="p8">
By pointing directly to the seal QR Scanner located at the entrance to the exhibition with yours cell phones or digital tablets we connect to the web page that allows us to use it freely as we walk through the museum, appreciating the artworks and continuing our dialogue with the installation. In addition the public can interact from anywhere in the world with the installation at Ponce time while the exhibition is displayed in the museum. When the exhibition ends the frequency clocks will be open universally.
</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

<p class="p8">
<i>Memory of nature: the rhythm of life</i>
refers to the mystical vision of the Museo de Arte de Ponce. Our museum was built in direction toward the sunrise, in the southern region of Puerto Rico and right on  front of the Caribbean Sea. We can see the light of dawn entering the museum by the glass wall that faces east and the garden of Granada. This continuous light coming through the windows and the seven skylights placed on the roof of the museum which in turn is run by the diagonal walls for natural lighting and by its height to its acoustics and we see the sunlight out through the west wall at the sunset.
</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

<p class="p8">
This concept of skylights where the sunlight enters is common in museums. Take the case of the pyramidal skylight in the Museum of Louvre in Paris designed by architect Pei that receives sunlight from the city of Paris or the skylight and walls of the Metropolitan Museum of New York City also designed by the same architect that receives the sunlight of this enigmatic city or as so many museums in the world. The sun is so important to the Museo de Arte de Ponce as the most museums in the world that have some form of entry of sunlight through the skylights, windows and glass doors.
</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

<p class="p8">
To conclude, as a way of reflection I want to say that we are graceful beings because we are seeing and articulating the beginning of this new era and XXI century. For the past 16 years we have had to confront and transform existing parameters at all levels of life for the benefit of future generations. As we know the beginning of the new era is characterized by the collapse of empires and lifting up of others. In particular, this era has been characterized as a period of global crisis. Therefore, we have a responsibility collectively to lead our planet in a positive direction for the benefit of humanity and its environment.
</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

<p class="p8">
Within this historical context I expressed my feelings as an arteologist. I hope my installation <i>Memory of nature: the rhythm of life</i> that refers to energy as the same in all parts of the world and that this energy can not be created or destroyed but influences every moment of our lives is experienced as an art of reflection on the creative process, energy balance and energy vibration. And that the act of individual and collective will be like watching and listening to the interior light and the feeling of profound cosmic vibrations of our new era.
